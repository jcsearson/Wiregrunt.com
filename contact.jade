				h2 Looking to get in touch?
				h4 Before you do, please consider the following:
				ul
					li Do you REALLY need to contact me?
					li If you aren't a developer, is this really worthwhile?
					li I'm always interested in working on new projects!
					li But am only really interested in talking to developers.
					li It's nothing personal...
					li I just dont believe in management jobs when it comes to code.
					li I mean, can you believe how much some of those guys make??
					li And they don't even know how to write code.
					li So remind me why we pay them so much?
					li Have you created websites before?
					li Well, before you take time to send me something...
					li Keep in mind that I have written a rather detailed contact form.
					li One that will ultimately make the decisions for me.
					li Much like Santa's elves decide who is naughty, and who's nice.
					li Do I need to read this?
					li Is it an attempt to express frustration over something I've said?
					li A fellow coder who wants to collaborate?
					li Let that one through!
					li You get the idea...
					li Happy form-filling!
